#### 0.3.7 - July 6 2015
* Inject OnModelCreating action for DataContext as static property

#### 0.3.6 - July 6 2015
* Inject OnModelCreating action for DataContext

#### 0.3.5 - March 27 2015
* Update migration config

#### 0.3.4 - March 27 2015
* Update migration logic (see Persistor tests for MySQL examples)

#### 0.3.3 - March 25 2015
* Fix F#.Core dep and pub date

#### 0.3.2 - August 21 2014
* IData as the most basic POCO without any pre-defined property (marker interface).


#### 0.3.1 - August 21 2014
* Make public DataContext, which is an EF dynamic context with all IData types that are loaded into current AppDomain
* Update NuGet dependencies

#### 0.3.0 - August 21 2014
* Use Entity Framework 6 with dynamic contexts and **automatic migrations** 
for non-destructive schema changes
* Use Entity Framework 6 for CRUD operations
* Soft-delete and soft-update, no destructive public methods on persistor
* Remove all ServiceStack dependencies

TODO
Add custom migrations as described [here](http://romiller.com/2013/02/15/extending-and-customizing-code-first-models-part-2-of-2/).

#### 0.2.6 - August 21 2014
* Fixed resultId naming bug when the same actor 'x' runs like: 
`(x.ParallelWith(x)).ContinueWith(x.ParallelWith(x))` 
or like `(x.ContinueWith(x)).ParallelWith(x.ContinueWith(x))`, etc. 
Now continuations and parallels must work always at least from the resultId naming perspective.

#### 0.2.5 - August 20 2014
* Fix connection collection logic

#### 0.2.4 - August 8 2014
* Reliable parallel actors execution with actor.ParallelWith(actor2).ParallelWith(actor3) etc

#### 0.2.3 - August 8 2014
* Connections: static methods to register and get Redis, IPoco, IBlob persistors and
same shortcut properties inside Actor definitions
* Some refactoring

#### 0.2.2 - August 5 2014
* Add config methods

#### 0.2.1 - August 5 2014
* Remove record types and FsPickler dependency


#### 0.2.0 - July 30 2014
* Concrete shards instead of virtual shards.
* Sequential GUID generator with timestamp.
* Use sequential GUIDs for primary everywhere. With timestamp stored inside GUID
there is effectively zero overhead. We always need 8 bytes timestamp and an incrementing ID
for clustered index, with sequential GUIDs we get both + distributed generation. (use NTP
to sync time on machines)
* ServiceStack.ORMLite.MySQL version with GUID stored as binary(16) 
(/lib with 4.0.23 version and [source here](https://github.com/buybackoff/ServiceStack.OrmLite)).


#### 0.1.1 - July 11 2014
* Rename to Ractor and change direction: the goal is to make CLR/JVM interoperable actors. An 
actor could be defined in any language on any platform and called from another platform. The only
requirement is that message types are defined on both platforms and are serializable to the same 
Json representation.


#### 0.1.0 - June 24 2014
* Stabilized public API - no more methods expected unless I cannot live without them
* Added Ractor.Persistence.AWS project with S3 IBlobPersistor and SQS IQueue implementations
* NOT TESTED, MANY REDIS METHODS ARE MISSING

#### 0.0.12 - June 19 2014
* ServiceStack.ORMLite v4 for POCOs

#### 0.0.10 - June 19 2014
* June 19 2014 update

#### 0.0.9 - May 5 2014
* C# methods and added FSharp.Core.dll to NuGet package

#### 0.0.8 - May 5 2014
* Main methods Post and PostAndReply tested for basic corectness (still could be unobvious issues)

#### 0.0.7 - May 4 2014
* Ractor first draft with actros

#### 0.0.4 - April 28 2014
* Add perstistence stuff (DB, files, queues) for which redis is cache

#### 0.0.3 - February 1 2014
* Keep things very simple and remove unneeded pool
